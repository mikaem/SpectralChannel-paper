  Abstract                 = {AbstractThe high-Reynolds-number behaviour of the canonical incompressible turbulent channel flow is investigated through large-scale direct numerical simulation (DNS). A Reynolds number is achieved (\$Re\_\{\textbackslashtau \} = h/\textbackslashdelta \_v \textbackslashapprox 4000\$, where \$h\$ is the channel half-height, and \$\textbackslashdelta \_v\$ is the viscous length scale) at which theory predicts the onset of phenomena typical of the asymptotic Reynolds number regime, namely a sensible layer with logarithmic variation of the mean velocity profile, and Kolmogorov scaling of the velocity spectra. Although higher Reynolds numbers can be achieved in experiments, the main advantage of the present DNS study is access to the full three-dimensional flow field.

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we apply a spectral multilevel method in the nonhomogeneous direction of a channel. The spectral tau method being not well suited to separate the scales, we use a Galerkin basis in the wall normal direction. Then we can separate the scales, as in the periodic case, from the spectral decomposition of the velocity field. In this way, the quantities associated with the small and large scales verify the no slip boundary conditions. Then, we resolve the large and the small scale equations, simplifying the computation of the small scales. Indeed, we use a quasi-static approximation to compute the small scales. As for the interaction terms, we apply a quasi-static approximation to estimate the modulus, the phase being updated, at each time step, in function of the large scales. To validate the method proposed, we have done two simulations of the channel with the multilevel method. They correspond to two different choices of the total number of modes and of the coarse cut-off level for the multilevel method in the wall normal direction. The results obtained are compared with the results stemming from direct numerical simulations (DNS): one fine DNS (fine resolution) and one low DNS (coarse resolution).},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this monograph is to describe the dynamic multilevel (DML) methodology applied to the numerical simulation of turbulence. The general setting of the Navier---Stokes equations is recalled, and also a number of basic notions on the statistical theory of turbulence. The practical limitations of direct numerical simulation (DNS) and the needs for modeling are emphasized. The objective of this article is to discuss the modeling and the numerical simulation of turbulent flows by multilevel methods related to the concept of approximate inertial manifolds (AIM). This mathematical concept stemming from the dynamical systems theory is briefly presented; AIM are based on a decomposition of the velocity field into small and large scale components; they give a slaving law of the small scales as a function of the large scales. The novel aspect of the work presented here is the time adaptative dynamical implementation of these multilevel methods. Indeed the DML methodology is based on the properties of this decomposition of the velocity field and on numerical arguments. Numerical analysis of multilevel methods for a simple system is proposed. DML methods, with some numerical and physical justifications, are described for homogeneous turbulence. The numerical results obtained are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Electronic structure calculations are a widely used tool in materials science and large consumer of supercomputing resources. Traditionally, the software packages for these kind of simulations have been implemented in compiled languages, where Fortran in its different versions has been the most popular choice. While dynamic, interpreted languages, such as Python, can increase the effciency of programmer, they cannot compete directly with the raw performance of compiled languages. However, by using an interpreted language together with a compiled language, it is possible to have most of the productivity enhancing features together with a good numerical performance. We have used this approach in implementing an electronic structure simulation software \{GPAW\} using the combination of Python and C programming languages. While the chosen approach works well in standard workstations and Unix environments, massively parallel supercomputing systems can present some challenges in porting, debugging and profiling the software. In this paper we describe some details of the implementation and discuss the advantages and challenges of the combined Python/C approach. We show that despite the challenges it is possible to obtain good numerical performance and good parallel scalability with Python based software. },

We stress that DNS is a research tool, and not a brute-force solution to the Navier-Stokes equations for engineering problems. The wide range of scales in turbulent flows requires that care be taken in their numerical solution. We discuss related numerical issues such as boundary conditions and spatial and temporal discretization. Significant insight into turbulence physics has been gained from DNS of certain idealized flows that cannot be easily attained in the laboratory. We discuss some examples. Further, we illustrate the complementary nature of experiments and computations in turbulence research. Examples are provided where DNS data has been used to evaluate measurement accuracy. Finally, we consider how DNS has impacted turbulence modeling and provided further insight into the structure of turbulent boundary layers. },

The use of uniform three-dimensional (3D) real-space grids for representing wave functions, densities, and potentials allows for flexible boundary conditions, efficient multigrid algorithms for solving Poisson and Kohn-Sham equations, and efficient parallelization using simple real-space domain-decomposition. We use the PAW method to perform all-electron calculations in the frozen core approximation, with smooth valence wave functions that can be represented on relatively coarse grids. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method by calculating the atomization energies of 20 small molecules, and the bulk modulus and lattice constants of bulk aluminum. We show that the approach in terms of computational efficiency is comparable to standard plane-wave methods, but the memory requirements are higher.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of the Navier Stokes equations is an invaluable research tool in fluid dynamics. Still, there are few publicly available research codes and, due to the heavy number crunching implied, available codes are usually written in low-level languages such as C/C++ or Fortran. In this paper we describe a pure scientific Python pseudo-spectral \{DNS\} code that nearly matches the performance of C++ for thousands of processors and billions of unknowns. We also describe a version optimized through Cython, that is found to match the speed of C++. The solvers are written from scratch in Python, both the mesh, the \{MPI\} domain decomposition, and the temporal integrators. The solvers have been verified and benchmarked on the Shaheen supercomputer at the \{KAUST\} supercomputing laboratory, and we are able to show very good scaling up to several thousand cores. A very important part of the implementation is the mesh decomposition (we implement both slab and pencil decompositions) and 3D parallel Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT). The mesh decomposition and \{FFT\} routines have been implemented in Python using serial \{FFT\} routines (either NumPy, pyFFTW or any other serial \{FFT\} module), NumPy array manipulations and with \{MPI\} communications handled by \{MPI\} for Python (mpi4py). We show how we are able to execute a 3D parallel \{FFT\} in Python for a slab mesh decomposition using 4 lines of compact Python code, for which the parallel performance on Shaheen is found to be slightly better than similar routines provided through the \{FFTW\} library. For a pencil mesh decomposition 7 lines of code is required to execute a transform. },
